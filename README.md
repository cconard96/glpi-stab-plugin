# Split Timeline Action Buttons (STAB)

Prior to GLPI 10.0, the followup and task forms in the timeline were split button dropdowns.
This allowed you to just add a followup/task or optionally add the followup/task and change the parent Ticket, Change, or Problem status.
This was useful to be able to quickly add the last task and close a ticket within the same action while only sending one notification.

Starting in GLPI 10.0, you have to add the followup/task and then change the status in two actions and triggers two notifications.

This plugin restores the split button to the task and followup forms.
